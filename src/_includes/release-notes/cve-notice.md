## CVE notice

Starting with the 2.3.2 release, we will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).
